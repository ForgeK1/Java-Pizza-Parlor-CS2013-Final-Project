/*
    1) Class Name: WordScramble

    2) How will this class work?:
        The player is presented with a set of random letters (Ex. abdoc), and the player is prompted to write out
        as many words as possible using those letters (coda, cab, bad, dab, cod, etc.
            --> https://wordfinder.yourdictionary.com/unscramble/yeabhdo/?dictionary=US

        Programming wise, we would have 5 different set of random letters where each set conveys to a total
        of 10 words

    3) Class made by: Keyvan M. Kani & MD Islam
