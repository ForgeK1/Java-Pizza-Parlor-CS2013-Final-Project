/*
    1) Class Name: HungryCustomers

    2) How will this class work?:
        As a pizza parlor co-owner with 4 different trays of Pizzas you are selling to your
        customers. There is a line of hungry customers who tell you to give them a specific
        pizza slice. As such, you have three lives and you must give out all of the pizzas
        in order to beat the minigame. Every time you give out the wrong one you will be
        deducted a life and if you reach 0 lives you will lose the minigame.
